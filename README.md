Implemented Convolutional Neural Network, Neural Network From Scratch.

1. Convolutional Neural Network : Implemented Convolutional Neural Network from SCRATCH for the recognition of digits(0-9) from 28*28 pixels images.  The network consists of 2 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers. Used 3*3 size filters between the convolutional layers. Trained the network on 25,000 images and got  an accuracy of 86% on the test dataset.

   Learned about  the implementation details of forward propagation and backward propagation algorithms used in CNN's and how different activation functions affect the training accuracy.

2. Neural Network : Implemented 1-hidden layer neural network for the classification of Iris Dataset. Learned about the detailed implementation of forward and backward propagation algorithms used in the neural network. Learned ways to easily compute gradients for any function.

3. Currently learning and working on the Recurrent Neural Networks.
